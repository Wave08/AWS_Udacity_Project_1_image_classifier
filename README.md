Dog Breed Detection Using CNN Models
About the Project
This project is a component of the AWS AI/ML Scholarship Program’s AI Programming with Python Nanodegree. Its goal is to identify dog breeds from images by leveraging pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) including ResNet, AlexNet, and VGG. The workflow includes extracting breed labels from image filenames, utilizing CNNs for classification, and evaluating each model’s performance.

Project Components
The project is divided into the following modules:

Image Classification:
check_images.py: Classifies images of pets using pre-trained CNN models.
classify_images.py: Performs the classification of pet images based on the chosen CNN model.
Utility Scripts:
get_input_args.py: Manages command-line arguments for flexible script execution.
get_pet_labels.py: Extracts breed labels from image filenames.
Results Management:
adjust_results4_isadog.py: Modifies the results to specify whether the labels are dogs.
calculates_results_stats.py: Computes statistical data for the classification results.
print_results.py: Displays a summary of the classification outcomes, highlighting any misclassifications.
Auxiliary Functions:
print_functions_for_lab_checks.py: Contains utility functions to facilitate debugging and lab verification.
dognames.txt: A text file listing all recognized dog names.
How to Execute
To run the project, follow these steps:

Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the project directory.
Execute the following command:
python check_images.py --dir <path_to_images> --arch <model_architecture> --dogfile dognames.txt

Output
Upon execution, the project generates a summary including:

Total Number of Images
Total Number of Dog Images
Total Number of Non-Dog Images
Accuracy of Dog Identification
Accuracy of Breed Identification
Accuracy of Non-Dog Classification
Overall Match Percentage
The results are broken down by model (ResNet, AlexNet, VGG), showing counts for correctly identified dogs and breeds. Misclassifications, if any, are also reported.
